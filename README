This a Oracle SQL database project created during my Databse class with Professor Jonathon Wilson. 

We designed our databse to resemble that of a fictional Amazon Warehouse. We had 19 tables in our database, all related to various aspects of accounting that a
Amazon warehouse would have to undertake. 

We created Stored Procedures, Views, and Triggers to view an employees schedule, access their pay and information, and what department they were in. For redundancy 
we only added in two employees, myself and my teamate.
